# MS Paint Clone

This repository contains an MS-Paint-like application developed for the "Programming in Graphical Environment" university course using **Windows Forms**. The application is designed to replicate basic functionalities of the traditional Microsoft Paint program, providing tools such as a pen, line drawing, selection capabilities, and the ability to invert colors of selected areas.

## Features

- **Pen Tool**: Draw freehand lines in any color.
- **Line Tool**: Draw straight lines.
- **Selection Tool**: Select an area of the canvas to perform operations such as color inversion.
- **Color Inversion**: Invert the colors on the selected area, or invert the whole canvas if nothing is selected.
